//1. Create an interface called IQuittable and have it define a void method called Quit().

//2. Have your Employee class from the previous drill inherit that interface and implement the Quit() method in any way you choose.

//3. Use polymorphism to create an object of type IQuittable and call the Quit() method on it. Hint: an object can be of an 
//interface type if it implements that specific interface.
