//1. Make the Employee class take a generic type parameter.

//2. Add a property to the Employee class called "things" and have its data type be a generic list matching the generic type of the class.

//3. Instantiate an Employee object with type "string" as its generic parameter.Assign a list of strings as the property value of Things.

//4. Instantiate an Employee object with type "int" as its generic parameter.Assign a list of integers as the property value of Things.
