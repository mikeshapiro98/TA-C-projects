//1. Create a class. In that class, create a method that will take in an integer, do a math operation to it and then 
//   return the answer as an integer.

//2. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the one method, passing in an integer. 3. Display the result to the screen.

//3. Add a second method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a decimal, do a different math
//   operation to it and then return the answer as an integer.

//4. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the second method, passing in a
//   decimal. Display the result to the screen.

//5. Add a third method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a string, convert it to an integer if 
//   possible, do a different math operation to it and then return the answer as an integer.

//6. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the third method, passing in a string
//   that equates to an integer.Display the result to the screen.
