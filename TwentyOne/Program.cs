//NOTES ON DATABASES AND ACCESS(SQL)
//SQL and C# are NOT the sae thing. Each should be treated appropriately. 
//When you want to access a SQL database from you C#(insert a string, pull record/map it, etc), you must ADO.NET
//ADO.NET is an obstraction layer for communicating with a database. You can write SQL directly into C# and execute them within the targeted database, then return results back to the application.
// !PATH! - View -> SQL server object explorer


//MORE NOTES ON EXCEPTIONS. 
//TRY CATCH IS NOT THE ONLY METHOD. YOU CAN ALSO USE TRYPARSE AND A WHILE LOOP
//USE A TIGHT WHILE LOOP TO KEEP TO ONE ANSWER. 
//TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM OF USERS PUTTING IN NEGATIVE NUMBERS AND GAINING MONEY IF THEY LOSE, YOU COULD EITHER USE AN IF(X <=0) OR YOU COULD USE A TRY CATCH BLOCK.
//YOU CAN EVEN PUT THE WHOLE PLAY METHOD IN A TRY CATCH BLOCK TO HAND ANY AND ALL ERRORS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN THAT METHOD.    
//IT'S GOOD TO BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE WHEN CATCHING EXCEPTIONS, THAT WAY YOU CAN HANDLE THEM APPROPRIATELY.
//CATCHES ARE DONE IN ORDER IF YOU STACK THEM. 
//START WITH MORE SPECIFIC EXCEPTIONS ABOVE AND MORE SPECIFIC ONES BELOW.
//YOU CAN ALSO CREATE YOUR OWN EXCEPTIONS. SEE FRAUD EXCEPTION CLASS
//ALL EXCEPTIONS INHERIT FROM BASE EXEPTION. (Polymorphism)


//NOTES ON GUIDS   
//THERES A CLASS IN c# THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CREAT A 'GLOBAL UNIQUE IDENTIFIER' (GUID)
//The advantage of this is that it can identify specific things (especiaally people)
//You could look someone up by name using their GUID. 
//You can create as many GUIDs as you want. The odds of getting the same GUID is unlikely because of the way they're built. 
//EXAMPLE:
//Guid identifier = Guid.NewGuid();  //basically you can pass in values and the algorythm uses those values to creat a GUID. Note the syntax looking different than other instansiations. SQL even has a GUID method
//They are always unique. 


//NOTES ON CREATING A CONSTANT
// DECLARING A CONTANT JUST MEANS THAT IT CAN'T CHANGE GIVING YOU MORE CONTROLL. 
//



//NOTES ON DECLARING JUST A VAR AS A VARIABLE
//Rule of thumb: If the data tyoe is ever in question. DECLARE THE DATA TYPE for readability by the human. 
//This should only be used if the data type is obvious.
//Harder way of declaring this variable.
//Dictionary <string, string> newDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();
//Easier way
//var newDictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();




//NOTES ON CONSTRUCTOR CALL CHAIN
//A CONSTRUCTOR CALL CHAIN IS A WAY TO DEFINE MULTIPLE CONSTRUCTORS AND UTILIZE EARLIER ONES TO PREVENT WRTING THINGS MORE THAN ONCE.
//THIS IS ALMOST INHERITING THE PROPERTIES FROM ONE CONSTRUCTOR INTO ANOTHER.

//NOTES ON LIBRARIES
//Everything but the program in 21 was added to a new project/namespace called casino. 
//A referance was then added to the 21 game (The casino) and it is pulling data from the new namspace (Library). 
//This gives almost a template for someone to create off of. 
//This can be thought of as layers of a project.
//Casino here is a library of things we could use.
//Anytime you change the library, you have to REBUILD IT!!!!!!!


//ACCESSABILITY MODIFIERS 
//PUBLIC, PRIVATE, ETC
//PUBLIC MEANS YOU CAN ACCESS IT FROM ANYWHERE.
//PRIVATE MEANS YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS IT WITHIN THE CLASS IT'S WITHIN
//PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ARE THE MOST COMMON. 
//PROTECTED MEANS IT'S LIMITED TO JUST THAT CLASS AND ANY THAT DERIVE FROM IT
//INTERAL MEANS THAT THESE METHODS CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED TO METHODS OF THE SAME ASSEMBLY. (IN THIS CASE ONLY CLASSES WITHIN CASINO CAN ACCESS IT AND NOT THE TWENTYONE GAME)
//THESE ALL HELP TO CONTROL YOUR CODE. USE THE ONE THAT BEST FITS YOU NEED. DON'T JUST MAKE EVERYTHING PUBLIC
//

//NOTES ON ASSEMBLY
//.NET FRAMEWORK MAKES ANY CODE YOU WRITE COMPILE IT TWICE. IT WILL BE COMPILED INTO A INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE USUALLY A .DLL OR .EXC. IT IS IN ESSANCE AN ESSEMBLY. IT THEN GETS COMPILED INTO WHATEVER MACHINE CODE IT WILL BE WORKING WITH BY THAT COMPUTER IT RUNS ON
//ASSEMBLY IS WHAT YOU GET AFTER YOU COMPILED YOUR c# CODE INTO INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE.
//THIS WILL COMIPLE INTO A .EXC AND THAT WOULD BE AN ASSEMBLY.
//LIST IS PART OF THE .NET FRAMEWORK. IT'S AN ASSEMBLY.


//NOTES ON NAMESPACES.
//NAMESPACESES ARE WAYS OR ORGANIZING YOUR CODE. 
//YOU COULD HAVE ONE CLASS CALLED CELL AND ONE CALLED PRODUCT.
//IMAGINE YOUR AMAZON. YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE CLASS CALLED CHAIR, BUT SEVERAL NAMESPACES CALLED "LAZYBOY", "ROCKER", ETC
//


//NOTES ON FILE I/O:
//THIS IS USED TO PRINT SOMETHING TO A TEXT DOCUMENT OR FILE.
//A broad use is logging
//Logging means putting an entry into a file or database based on an action of the program.
//We will be adding logging to every card dealt. 


//NOTES ON LAMDA EXPRESSIONS
//1. This helps to shorten certain tasks like incrementation.
//2. Saves time.
//3. Format "x" in the above example could be anything. You can give it whatever title you'd like. 
//4. => is a distinct lamda expression that that essentially means to evaluate this to each item.
//5. They are very hard to debug compared to say a for loop. You can't go line by line through a Lambda expression. Especially when chaining them together.
//6. It can also make it hard to read. 



//NOTES ON STRUCTS 
//1. Every data type in C# is either a refernce type or a value type.
//2. Think of if you submitted an essay to your teacher and instead of turning it in, you put it on Google Drive so that when she made changes you could see it too. It's a solo address with 2 manipulators. It's the same document even though it seems different. 
//3. Any data type that stores value by referance is a referance data type. This includes all classes.
//4. In the example in number 2 the copy of the assignment vs. putting it on Google Drive would be a value type not a referance type.
//5. Structs are essentially classes except it's a value type rather than a referance type.
//6. Structs CANT be inherited.
//7. Value types cannot have a value of null because it is not a value

//REFERANCE TYPE:
//string
//card
//list


//VALUE TYPES: 
//int
//bool
//enums
//datetime

//NOTES THAT HAVE BEEN DELETED FROM PROGRAM

// var newPlayer = new Player("Jesse"); //AFTER ADDING THIS THE LIBRARY NEEDED TO BE REBUILT BEFORE IT RAN SUCCESSFULLY.

// FOR EXAMPLE:

// POLYMORPHISM IS THE ABILITY OF A CLASS TO MORPH INTO ITS INHERITING CLASS WHICH GIVES CERTAIN ADVANTAGES.
