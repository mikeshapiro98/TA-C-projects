//NOTES ON ENUMS
//Can be used to limit the amount of options a user can you you. 
//Assigned as a data type which dictates what the data type can be.
//If you assign a element to an enum it cam be used in say a drop down menu. 
//Eliminates user input errors because it forces the value you want it to the data type. 
//Another benefit is that it uses intellisence to show you the options of what you can assign. This makes the programming eaiser 
//Enums have an underlaying data type. For example: SUIT: SPADES is technically a string.
//In theory you could convert a suit in this situation to an integer. It would assign it it's index number by default, but you can also asign it, its own number.
